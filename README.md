Project I made during an internship at NCSU in 2023. 
Takes in an amino acid sequence as input, and outputs whether it's a restriction modification system protein or not. 
If it is an RMS protein, it tells what type it thinks it is.

You can test it with RMSI_model_1.pth, A._ferrooxidans_proteins.zip, and model_testing.ipynb. Or use your own amino acid seqs.
